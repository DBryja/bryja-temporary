        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>I am 23 years old and an aspiring web developer studying at the Cracow University of Technology.</p>
          <p>
            I strive to create websites that not only look great but also stand out in terms of user experience and
            unique visual storytelling.
          </p>
          <p>
            My dream is to collaborate with cohesive teams on unconventional projects. I am especially interested in
            working with teams where everyone can influence the project's direction and where a culture of collaboration
            thrives. Sharing knowledge and inspiring one another are crucial elements that significantly contribute to
            my growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides working as a developer, I derive great satisfaction from sharing knowledge and supporting others in
            their development.
          </p>
          <p>
            I live in a small town in the Żywiec Beskids, but my ambitions reach far beyond local boundaries. I am
            looking for a place where I can grow, create top-level projects, and pursue my passion for building
            websites.
